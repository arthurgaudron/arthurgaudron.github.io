# Introduction

## Industry 4.0

 - direct digital manufacturing (DDM) or 3D printing
 - artificial intelligence
 - unmanned aerial systems (UAS) or drones
 - blockchain
 - RFID
 - etc.

---

## Emergence and spread of an innovation
- "DDM's higher costs, it is mainly used in operational settings for tasks such as prototyping, “soft tooling,” and the on-demand production of customized and spare parts (Campbell et al., 2018; Khajavi et al., 2015)."
- "Shell, for example, inspects flare stacks on oil platforms using drones (Royal Dutch Shell, 2016); Zipline uses them to deliver medical products, including blood and vaccines, in several African countries (Simmons, 2016); and IKEA has started using them to implement continual inventory control in its warehouses (IKEA, 2020)"

# Advanced manufacturing technology (AMT)

"AMT, which could “control, track, or monitor manufacturing activities, either directly or indirectly” (Boyer et al., 1997, p. 332)"

"A key theme in the AMT literature (e.g., Jaikumar, 1986; Meredith, 1987; Upton, 1995) was that the challenge of realizing benefits was not a problem “in the technology itself, even though it is new and unstable” (Hayes & Jaikumar, 1991, p. 170) but, instead, was determined by the appropriateness of associated decisions and processes—primarily in terms of the technologies' fit or match with a range of internal and external contingencies."

Three types of fits in the classic AMT literature. These are the fit between the technology and 
1. economic and strategic factors, 
2. operational and supply chain factors, and 
3. organizational and behavioral factors.

## Technological fit with economic and strategic factors

"Creating “a business case” is critical to this phase, which means identifying and comparing measurable benefits and costs of the technology option (Burcher et al., 1999)."
- "Managers calculate or estimate economic potential using project finance techniques"
- "AMT researchers have long stressed the limitations of any overreliance on narrow capital budgeting-centered approaches."

It may be truer for infrastructure technologies that have many direct and indirect outcomes (both positive or negative)

Das and Narasimhan (2001, p. 539) reported that “the use of AMT … does not appear to encourage firms to assume ‘off diagonal’ positions in the Hayes and Wheelwright (1979) framework.” (Hayes, R. H., & Jaikumar, R. (1991). Requirements for successful implementation of new manufacturing technologies. Journal of Engineering and Technology Management, 7(3–4), 169–175. )

Hayes and Jaikumar (1991, p. 173) argued for a form of options-based appraisal (cf. Pandza et al., 2003), given that many AMT benefits cannot be defined until after the knowledge they create has been assimilated: “Investments in new technology often resemble the ante in a poker game. One does not expect any direct return from the ante itself. It simply allows one to play the next set of cards.”

**off-diagonal**

“We find that—when faced with fast-emerging technologies in thriving ecosystems—companies do not follow a linear technology adoption pattern, where adoption commonly starts with a business case. Instead, companies trial technologies by focusing on a “use case,” which allows a potential business case to evolve, or not, over time.”

## Technological fit with operational and supply chain factors

how the technology integrates with the firms' operating model (Frohlich & Dixon, 1999; Leonard-Barton & Deschamps, 1988; Tyre & Orlikowski, 1994)

This can be particularly challenging if the process affects routines, responsibilities, and reporting channels (Meredith, 1987).

In the classic AMT literature (e.g., computer-aided manufacturing, flexible manufacturing systems, etc.) were mainly developed for specific manufacturing applications. 
- the role of supply systems has been under-investigated.
- In areas where research has been conducted (e.g., Bessant, 1994), it has been suggested that suppliers perceived most of their buyers (i.e., the manufacturing firms) as unsophisticated customers
- This buyer–supplier knowledge gap would only exacerbate the challenge of operational fit.

## Technological fit with organizational and behavioral factors

If any new technology is to be fully implemented, it will require acceptance by users (e.g., Venkatesh & Davis, 2000)
- technology adoption process (Waldeck & Leffakis, 2007). 
- training is key 

In change management, there is more than training 
- More recent literature examines the managerial behavioral aspects of technology adoption (e.g., Bendoly & Cotteleer, 2008; **Loch, 2017**; Roscoe et al., 2019)

# Drones as an emerging technology and the three types of fit

---

## Not a traditionnal AMT
- not intended for manufacturing applications (leisure and military)
- flying is unprecedent in factory : open new possibilities but with constraints (flight time, payload, wind turbulence, noise, safety, privacy)
- flexibility of the on-board equipment (cameras, sensors, and robotic arms)
- users are familiar with the technology

## #1 Fit with economic and strategic factors

The business case for drones remains unclear compared with traditional investment options such as forklifts, mounted cameras, and material handling systems.

## The Productivity J-Curve for GPT

Brynjolfsson, Erik, Daniel Rock, et Chad Syverson. « The Productivity J-Curve: How Intangibles Complement General Purpose Technologies ». American Economic Journal: Macroeconomics 13, nᵒ 1 (janvier 2021): 333‑72. https://doi.org/10.1257/mac.20180386.

## #2 Fit with operational and supply chain factors

Market pull versus technology push (Mowery & Rosenberg, 1979; Nemet, 2009)

 - drones, were developed for non-OM applications and are being pushed onto OM problems
 -  it is often unclear whether a problem needs a technological solution or a technology seeks a problem to resolve

## Drone technology ecosystems

One way to address a low perceived fit between emerging technologies and internal operational factors might be to outsource development and deployment to specialized suppliers.

The vivid drone startup industry is actively looking for development partners, implementation pilot projects, and potential customers.

## #3 Fit with organizational and behavioral factors

New technology

 - no organizational structures
 - require extensive training

Automation raise the employment question

Creates risks

Negative opinion about the tech

## Problematic

Drones do not appear to have favorable starting conditions for achieving a fit with any of the three factors.

Why then do companies continue to explore and pilot drones in their operations, and how do companies move from early ideas to matured applications?
