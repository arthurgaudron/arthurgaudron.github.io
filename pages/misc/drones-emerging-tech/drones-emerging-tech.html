<h1>Theoritical framework</h1>

</section>
<section id="advanced-manufacturing-technology-amt" class="slide level2">
<h2>Advanced manufacturing technology (AMT)</h2>
<p>“AMT, which could “control, track, or monitor manufacturing activities, either directly or indirectly” (Boyer et al., 1997, p. 332)"</p>
<p>“A key theme in the AMT literature (e.g., Jaikumar, 1986; Meredith, 1987; Upton, 1995) was that the challenge of realizing benefits was not a problem “in the technology itself, even though it is new and unstable” (Hayes &amp; Jaikumar, 1991, p. 170) but, instead, was determined by the appropriateness of associated decisions and processes—primarily in terms of the technologies’ fit or match with a range of internal and external contingencies."</p>
</section>
<section id="three-types-of-fits-in-the-classic-amt-literature." class="slide level2">
<h2>Three types of fits in the classic AMT literature.</h2>
<p>These are the fit between the technology and</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>economic and strategic factors,</li>
<li>operational and supply chain factors, and</li>
<li>organizational and behavioral factors.</li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="technological-fit-with-economic-and-strategic-factors" class="slide level2">
<h2>Technological fit with economic and strategic factors</h2>
<p>“Creating “a business case” is critical to this phase, which means identifying and comparing measurable benefits and costs of the technology option (Burcher et al., 1999)." - “Managers calculate or estimate economic potential using project finance techniques” - “AMT researchers have long stressed the limitations of any overreliance on narrow capital budgeting-centered approaches.”</p>
<p>It may be truer for infrastructure technologies that have many direct and indirect outcomes (both positive or negative)</p>
<p>Das and Narasimhan (2001, p. 539) reported that “the use of AMT … does not appear to encourage firms to assume ‘off diagonal’ positions in the Hayes and Wheelwright (1979) framework.” (Hayes, R. H., &amp; Jaikumar, R. (1991). Requirements for successful implementation of new manufacturing technologies. Journal of Engineering and Technology Management, 7(3–4), 169–175. )</p>
<p>Hayes and Jaikumar (1991, p. 173) argued for a form of options-based appraisal (cf. Pandza et al., 2003), given that many AMT benefits cannot be defined until after the knowledge they create has been assimilated: “Investments in new technology often resemble the ante in a poker game. One does not expect any direct return from the ante itself. It simply allows one to play the next set of cards.”</p>
<p><strong>off-diagonal</strong></p>
<p>“We find that—when faced with fast-emerging technologies in thriving ecosystems—companies do not follow a linear technology adoption pattern, where adoption commonly starts with a business case. Instead, companies trial technologies by focusing on a “use case,” which allows a potential business case to evolve, or not, over time.”</p>
</section>
<section id="technological-fit-with-operational-and-supply-chain-factors" class="slide level2">
<h2>Technological fit with operational and supply chain factors</h2>
<p>how the technology integrates with the firms’ operating model (Frohlich &amp; Dixon, 1999; Leonard-Barton &amp; Deschamps, 1988; Tyre &amp; Orlikowski, 1994)</p>
<p>This can be particularly challenging if the process affects routines, responsibilities, and reporting channels (Meredith, 1987).</p>
<p>In the classic AMT literature (e.g., computer-aided manufacturing, flexible manufacturing systems, etc.) were mainly developed for specific manufacturing applications. - the role of supply systems has been under-investigated. - In areas where research has been conducted (e.g., Bessant, 1994), it has been suggested that suppliers perceived most of their buyers (i.e., the manufacturing firms) as unsophisticated customers - This buyer–supplier knowledge gap would only exacerbate the challenge of operational fit.</p>
</section>
<section id="technological-fit-with-organizational-and-behavioral-factors" class="slide level2">
<h2>Technological fit with organizational and behavioral factors</h2>
<p>If any new technology is to be fully implemented, it will require acceptance by users (e.g., Venkatesh &amp; Davis, 2000) - technology adoption process (Waldeck &amp; Leffakis, 2007). - training is key</p>
<p>In change management, there is more than training - More recent literature examines the managerial behavioral aspects of technology adoption (e.g., Bendoly &amp; Cotteleer, 2008; <strong>Loch, 2017</strong>; Roscoe et al., 2019)</p>

<h1>Field of study</h1>

</section>
<section id="drones-are-not-a-traditional-amt" class="slide level2">
<h2>Drones are not a traditional AMT</h2>
<ul>
<li>not intended for manufacturing applications (leisure and military)</li>
<li>flying is unprecedent in factory : open new possibilities but with constraints (flight time, payload, wind turbulence, noise, safety, privacy)</li>
<li>flexibility of the on-board equipment (cameras, sensors, and robotic arms)</li>
<li>users are familiar with the technology</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="fit-with-economic-and-strategic-factors" class="slide level2">
<h2>#1 Fit with economic and strategic factors</h2>
<p>The business case for drones remains unclear compared with traditional investment options such as forklifts, mounted cameras, and material handling systems.</p>

<h2>#2 Fit with operational and supply chain factors</h2>
<p>Market pull versus technology push (Mowery &amp; Rosenberg, 1979; Nemet, 2009)</p>
<ul>
<li>drones, were developed for non-OM applications and are being pushed onto OM problems</li>
<li>it is often unclear whether a problem needs a technological solution or a technology seeks a problem to resolve</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="drone-technology-ecosystems" class="slide level2">
<h2>Drone technology ecosystems</h2>
<p>One way to address a low perceived fit between emerging technologies and internal operational factors might be to outsource development and deployment to specialized suppliers.</p>
<p>The vivid drone startup industry is actively looking for development partners, implementation pilot projects, and potential customers.</p>
</section>
<section id="fit-with-organizational-and-behavioral-factors" class="slide level2">
<h2>#3 Fit with organizational and behavioral factors</h2>
<p>New technology</p>
<ul>
<li>no organizational structures</li>
<li>require extensive training</li>
</ul>
<p>Automation raise the employment question</p>
<p>Creates risks</p>
<p>Negative opinion about the tech</p>
</section></section>
<section id="research-question" class="title-slide slide level1">
<h1>Research question</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>Drones do not appear to have favorable starting conditions for achieving a fit with any of the three factors.</p></li>
<li><p>Why then do companies continue to explore and pilot drones in their operations, and how do companies move from early ideas to matured applications?</p></li>
</ul>
</section>

<section id="methodology" class="title-slide slide level1">
<h1>Methodology</h1>
<p>This research is a multi-year analysis of drone applications in OM.</p>
<p>It takes particular inspiration from Pettigrew’s longitudinal case research method (e.g., Pettigrew, 1985, 1990; Pettigrew et al., 2001) and Langley’s process studies (e.g., Langley et al., 2013; Langley &amp; Truax, 1994).</p>
<p>Case studies are useful when exploring questions about the “why” and “how” of concepts (Yin, 2013)</p>

<section id="the-use-case" class="slide level2">
<h2>The use case</h2>
<p>It differs from the business case, and it comes from Informations Systems literature</p>
<p>In many ways, the use case is a manifestation of what Orlikowski (2000) called the idea of “technology in practice,” which is a perspective that starts with human action and examines how structures emerge through recurrent interactions with available technology. She notes that some technologies-in-practice (not all) can become institutionalized over time, but this is rarely permanent. Moreover, the familiar “black box” notion of technology only exists as a result of stable patterns of use (Latour, 1987). In observing this nascent technology, we were inside the black box and were forced to explore different possible technological–organizational connections.</p>
